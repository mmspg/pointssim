% Error map of point cloud Y, based on relative difference between
%   associated feature maps of X and Y.
%
%   [eMapYX] = error_map(fMapY, fMapX, idYX, CONST)
%
%   INPUTS
%       fMapX: Feature map of point cloud X. The size is Nx1, with N the
%           number of points of X.
%       fMapY: Feature map of point cloud Y. The size is Mx1, with M the
%           number of points of Y.
%       idYX: Indices to associate points from Y in X. The size is Mx1.
%       CONST: Defines a constant that is included in the relative
%           difference computation to avoid undefined operations.
%
%   OUTPUTS
%       eMapYX: Error map of point cloud Y, using X as reference. The size
%           is Mx1, with M the number of points of Y.


eMapYX = abs(fMapX(idYX) - fMapY)./(max([abs(fMapX(idYX)), abs(fMapY)], [], 2) + CONST);
